# Pico / RP2040 FFT for 240x240 SPI LCD

This is an adaptation of @vha3's [Realtime Audio FFT to VGA Display with RP2040](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/VGA/FFT.html).

It has been partially rewritten to favour C++isms and support a [240x240 SPI LCD](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/1-3-spi-colour-lcd-240x240-breakout).

See the original code in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aibPy4yzCk and a [detailed explanation of the FFT code](https://vanhunteradams.com/FFT/FFT.html).

I have taken many liberties with this code, possibly breaking it in subtle ways. I recommend referring to the original!
